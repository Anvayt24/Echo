# Echo
Echo is a name of the laptop assistant which I am working on since past few days .
This is a simple project where using voice commmands i can control my windows laptop.

*the project is still under process , and i am working on it currently adding more features and commands ,

Just by voice commands the Program can :
* control the volume of the laptop when using any app
* open any website
* search through wikipedia
* write and send email to anyone
* give weather updates
* add reminders

(I WILL BE ADDING MORE ADVANCED FEATURES TO IT )
